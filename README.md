# General Signal Generator (MATLAB)

This project implements an interactive MATLAB program that allows the user to generate **piecewise continuous-time signals** and apply various **time-domain operations**.

## Features
- User-defined time range and sampling frequency
- Support for multiple signal types:
  - DC
  - Ramp
  - Polynomial
  - Exponential
  - Sinusoidal
- Piecewise signal construction using breakpoints
- Time-domain operations:
  - Amplitude scaling
  - Time shifting
  - Time reversal
  - Expansion
  - Compression

## Concepts Covered
- Signals and Systems
- Continuous-time signal sampling
- Logical indexing in MATLAB
- Time-domain signal operations

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run the file:
   ```matlab
   general_signal_generator
